Interactive game for children ages 5-8 with an educational twist. Each level has a different topic (e.g. colours, jobs, animals etc.). The game aims to help children learn associations between certain items (e.g. a person with the workplace). Each level is designed to learn different theme, additional levels and categories can be easily added in the future to help children in learning different things (e.g. numbers, letters, etc.)
